# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working at [SEON](https://seon.io), where I am performing software testing on their web-based product.  
These github repos are my personal, open-source projects, in no particular order:  

## [Project Euler](https://github.com/sevmarc/project_euler)

This project contains solutions to many amths related problems - mostly created in Python, some C++ and Haskell. The list of questions (for which the algorithms had to be created) can be found at [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net)

## [Cybersecurity](https://github.com/sevmarc/cybersecurity)

Contains some cybersecurity solutions, and a small cryptography library.

## [Wrangler-fork](https://github.com/sevmarc/wrangler)

A fork of the Wrangler tool, which is a plugin, used for code refactoring [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org) programs. My contribution relates to user-created code refactoring functions - using a meta-language for the AST-transformations.

## [Bucketlist](https://github.com/sevmarc/bucketlist)

Bucketlist was created to learn markdown notetaking, using [Obsidian](obsidian.md). The notes contain a list of locations I hope to visit one day. A simple python module was also created to parse the location info,  
and map it on an [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org) map.  

## Some smaller projects

- [Simple website](https://github.com/sevmarc/sevmarc.github.io)
  - Check out the public source code of this simple website: [sevmarc.github.io](https://sevmarc.github.io)
- Basic [vehicle simulation](https://github.com/sevmarc/vehicle_simulation-swtesting_practice) in Python
- Basic [linux commands](https://github.com/sevmarc/configs-linux-knowhow), wargames solutions
