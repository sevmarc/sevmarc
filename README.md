### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working at [SEON](seon.io), where I am performing software testing on their web-based product.  
These github repos are my personal, open-source projects, in no particular order:  

#### [Project Euler](https://github.com/sevmarc/project_euler)
This project contains solutions to many amths related problems - mostly created in Python, some C++ and Haskell.   
The list of questions (for which the algorithms had to be created) can be found at [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net)

#### [Cybersecurity](https://github.com/sevmarc/cybersecurity)
Contains some cybersecurity solutions, and a small cryptography library.

#### [Wrangler-fork](https://github.com/sevmarc/wrangler)
A fork of the Wrangler tool, which is a plugin, used for code refactoring [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org) programs.  
My contribution relates to user-created code refactoring functions - using a meta-language for the AST-transformations.

#### [Bucketlist](https://github.com/sevmarc/bucketlist)
Bucketlist was created to learn markdown notetaking, using [Obsidian](obsidian.md).  
The notes contain a list of locations I hope to visit one day. A simple python module was also created to parse the location info,  
and map it on an [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org) map.
